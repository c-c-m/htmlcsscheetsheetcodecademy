  <h1>My HTML/CSS cheat sheet</h1>
    <!--^^this is a my title h1 biggest font in html h6 is smallest--> 
  
    <h4>
    I <strong>should</strong> <em>write</em> something here.¯\_(ツ)_/¯ <br>
There are four steps to the <a href="https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/" target="_blank">Feynman Learning Technique:</a> 

      <!--the <strong> tag makes things bold <em> makes them italics>
a href="https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/">Feynman Learning Technique:</a> okay so the <a> is an achor tag you attatch it to a word or phrase for external link. href means hypertext reference then you add the link folling the link after the link target="_blank" opens a new window with out that it will open in your current window. after the > is where you put the words you want to send people to the link.they will be blue-->   
      
      <ol> <!--this is for ordered lists-->
        <li>Choose a concept you want to learn about</li>
        <li>Pretend you are teaching it to a student in grade 6</li>
        <li>Identify gaps in your explanation;</li>
        <li>Go back to the source material, to better understand it.
  Review and simplify (optional)</li>
    </ol> 
 <!--for unordered lists use <ul></ul> then you can change it from a dot,or a square coders choice. :) --> 
    
    This being said; in the code I've made an obnoxious amount of comments/notes in the code to help me learn. I hope it helps someone work on their cheat sheet and understand html better. Thank you for checking out my project.
